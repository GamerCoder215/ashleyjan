I am currently pursuing an MFA in Painting full time. 

While in the program, I am investigating the themes of my identity, lineage and ancestry by exploring my past. 

In researching my family history I am able to make better sense of my present and gain clarity for my future. 

I want to piece together the missing information that was lost and deliberately taken away. 

Using self-reflection as a constant metaphorical theme throughout the work, I am highlighting the people in my life that I have descended from and to whom I feel most connected. 

My parents, grandparents, spouse and self are a direct reflection of who I am from the past, in the present and who I will become in the future. 

I want to honor the struggle and sacrifice of my ancestors while engaging in the dialogue of what it means to be an American family.
