I am addressing the growing crisis of the black material mortality rate in America through painting, audio and mixed media. Pictorial narratives of familial and generated dynamism were the foundation of my investigation of the self.

Those portraits continue to inform my recent work that has shifted towards a maternal concentration. I am confronting the trauma surrounding my entrance in motherhood in October 2018, by creating discourse covering self-reflection, personal empowerment, and black trandscendence in the midst of adversity.
